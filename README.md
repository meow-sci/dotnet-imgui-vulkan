# Goal

To build a dotnet 10 console application which uses Hexa.NET.ImGui to run ImGui from C# dotnet 10.

This must use either GLFW or SDL2 backend for windowing.

This must use Vulkan backend for rendering.

This should be a minimum viable application with minimum required dependencies and code to build an run.

It should render a simple ImGui window with some text only.
